# Animals Crossing
A simple single player game made in Unity (C#) during Gamecraft! 2019, an annual 24-hour game-jam competition hosted by the NUS Games Development Group in December 2019. The theme of the competition was "Save".

For the citizens of SoC-Town, everyday is a struggle for survival. Due to a severe lack of foresight by its founders, the entire town was built without traffic lights and proper pedestrian crossings. You play as the newly hired traffic controller of Soc-Town. Click on the button next to the junctions to change the flow of traffic, and prevent as many deaths as you can!
